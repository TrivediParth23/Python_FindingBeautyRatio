# Python_FindingBeautyRatio

## Overview
`Python_FindingBeautyRatio` is a Python project that utilizes OpenCV to analyze and calculate the beauty ratio of a face from an image. The project uses facial landmarks and symmetry analysis to estimate the proportion of key facial features, which are traditionally associated with beauty.

## Features
- Detects faces and facial landmarks using OpenCV.
- Calculates the beauty ratio based on facial symmetry.
- Supports various image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Dlib (for facial landmark detection)

## Acknowledgments
- OpenCV for facial detection and image processing.
- Dlib for facial landmark detection.
